## Engineering Principles

- **Human-Centered Design**  
  Technology should adapt to people—not the other way around.

- **Trust First**  
  Security, clarity, and reliability are non-negotiable.

- **Scalable by Default**  
  Every system is designed to grow without breaking.

- **Responsible Intelligence**  
  AI should be explainable, ethical, and purposeful.
